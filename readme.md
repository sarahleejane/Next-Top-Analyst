#Data science challenge using Python & Stats

##Details of the problem
This is about searching for a new top analyst. We already know of an excellent candidate with top analytical and programming skills. Unfortunately, we don't know her exact whereabouts but we only have some vague information where she might be. Can you tell us where to best send our recruiters and plot an easy to read map of your solution for them?

This is what we could extract from independent sources:

* The candidate is likely to be close to the river Spree. The probability at any point is given by a Gaussian function of its shortest distance to the river. The function peaks at zero and has 95% of its total integral within +/-2730m.
* A probability distribution centered around the Brandenburg Gate also informs us of the candidate's location. The distribution’s radial profile is log-normal with a mean of 4700m and a mode of 3877m in every direction.
* A satellite offers further information: with 95% probability she is located within 2400 m distance of the satellite’s path (assuming a normal probability distribution)
